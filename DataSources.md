# DATA SCIENCE AND COOKING DATA SOURCES 

## CONTEXT 

The whole project has it owns database consolidating information from several open data sources. These data sources are disconnected, but the DB for the project built connections between them using criteria allowing a multiperspective analysis on Cooking and the food production system.  

These connections allow analysing factors like Cooking Techniques, Biology of Molecules, Economy - Costs, Personal Health, General Health and Analysis at a National Level.
